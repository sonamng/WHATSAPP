# WHATSAPP

In this project too, he has done a lot of hard work. 
In this, first of all, a div was created for Navbar and put the image of WhatsApp in it.
After that made a separate div for the page of Whatsapp and in it I have taken the heading and paragrapag, 
then made a separate div by <p> tag and then made a separate page and made a circle in it and put hello and emoji in it. 
After that wrote the foter code, in that also we took different divs and put them in a mem div, flexed the display 
and made the background color black.
